A package to provide flexible and extendable interfaces to provide game logic, audio, game timers/countdowns and themeing to build a bubble popping game in Flutter.

## Getting Started

* Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  
  pop_pop: <version>
```

This package is implemented in [pop_pop_components](https://pub.dev/pop_pop_components), which provides some default game widgets and implementations out of the box, while still leaving flexibility to implement with your own state management solution.
